/*
 * To write a code in Java:-
 * 1. In Java first we create a class
 * 2. Then we create a function in it
 * 3. In that function we transmute psuedo code into logical form
 * 4. To save file make sure you are saving it with the same name you have created main class of program. 
 * 
 * How your code is running ?
 * JDK(Java Dev. Kit) = JRE(Java run env.) + Development Tools
 * JRE = JVM(Java virtual Machine) + Libraries
 * 1. COMPILATION:
 * Source Code(ext: Prog1.java) -> Compiler(In JDK) -> Byte Code(ext: xyz.class) 
 * This Byte Code can run on any machine provided JRE is present.
 * 2. EXECUTION:
 * Byte Code -> JVM -> native code(code that machine understands)
 * 
 * Code Components:
 * 1. Function: void main(){}
 * Used to perform some operations, required as per psuedo code
 * 2. Class: Class class_name{void Function1(){} void Function2(){}.. so on}
 * Entity that can contain more than one function
 * 'Main()' function is executed first then rest of the functions sequentially.
